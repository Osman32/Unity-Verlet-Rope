# Unity-Verlet-Rope
Unity Rope Physics Simulator

Uses Verlet Integration to simulate realistic rope like physics.
The current implementation supports circle colliders only.  

You can currently use this as an example on how to apply constraints to a verlet simulated rope in Unity.

There is currently a demo here - clicking the mouse will lock the rope in place.
